## 🎯 About Me

I’m an AI Engineer focused on building production-grade intelligent systems at the intersection of Agentic AI, retrieval-augmented architectures, and scalable backend platforms. My work centers on designing end-to-end solutions that combine modern language models, data pipelines, and distributed services to solve real-world automation and intelligence problems.

I specialize in developing AI-powered platforms that move beyond prototypes—systems that integrate reasoning agents, real-time processing, and robust APIs to support enterprise workflows and product-grade applications. My experience spans RAG systems, AI orchestration engines, computer vision pipelines, and cloud-deployed SaaS backends, with an emphasis on reliability, extensibility, and system design.

**What I Do:**
- 🤖 Agentic AI systems and multi-step reasoning workflows
- 🔍 Retrieval-augmented generation and knowledge platforms
- 🏗️ Production-grade backend and AI service architectures
- ⚡ Intelligent automation and data processing systems
- 🚀 Full-cycle AI product development and deployment
